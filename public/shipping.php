                 	<p>The DVD Store provides fast shipping within Australia though does not ship internationally.</p>

<p>A postage and handling charge of $9.95 applies to all orders delivered anywhere in Australia. This flat rate postage charge covers your entire order regardless of the number of DVDs or games in your order. The more you buy the more you save.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Delivery methods include:</b>
<ul><li>Regular Australia Post delivery
<li>Express Post delivery and courier delivery</li>
<li>You may make your selection upon checkout.</li></ul></p>

<p>We aim to supply you with any DVD, Blu Ray, Video Game and Box Set that is available in Australia in a timely manner.  We keep most titles in stock and hence dispatch most orders within 24 hours. However as there are a huge number of titles available in Australia we are unable to keep all titles on hand.  Therefore, to allow us to offer you one of the largest DVD ranges in Australia, if we do not have your ordered title in stock, we place an order with our suppliers and once we receive the title we ship it direct to you, this may result in a waiting period of approximately 7-14 days (subject to the availability at our supplier's warehouse). If we do not hold your DVD in stock we will email you within 1 working day of placing your order.</p>

<p>In most cases we will hold your items in stock and hence it will be shipped within 1 working day of receiving your order, therefore delivery time within Australia should be less than 7 days.</p>

<p>If you have any queries in relation to the shipping of your order please email us at <a href="mailto:contact@thedvdstore.com.au?Subject=Shipping%20again" target="_top">contact@thedvdstore.com.au</a></p>
